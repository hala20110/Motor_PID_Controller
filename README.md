# Motor PID Control with Soft Start Filter

This project implements a PID controller on Arduino to control the speed of a DC motor. The motor control is enhanced by a **soft start filter** using an **Exponential Smoothing Filter** to prevent abrupt changes in motor speed during startup. Additionally, the PID control logic is implemented as a class to make the code modular and reusable.
